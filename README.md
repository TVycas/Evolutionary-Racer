# Genetic Racer


## Description

My attempt at creating a genetic algorithm that over many generations manages to reach the end of the given track. Based on a book "The Nature of Code" by  Daniel Shiffman.
   
The simulation is displayed using p5py and collions are handled by pumynk physics engine.

  

#### Technologies

- Python 3.6
- p5py library
- pymunk physics engine

## How To Use

Run the sketch.py file to run with default parameters.
Or use addition flags to indicate custom parameters:  
-p \<Population size>  
-m \<Mutation rate>  
-t \<Track file>
